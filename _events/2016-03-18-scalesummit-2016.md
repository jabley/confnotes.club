Went to [ScaleSummit][scalesummit] again. It was good. Put [my notes in a gist][gist] this time, to
see if people wanted to comment on them.

This year was slightly different for me, since I was able to sponsor the
conference. Partly this was because I wanted to recruit good people to come work
at Marks and Spencer, and partly because it's a community that I have a lot of
love for. It's where I come from, and it was lovely to be able to give back in
some small way.
